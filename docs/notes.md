# Notes

Contains some thoughts over the development time of the project.

- Is it worth separating the SCK and RCK lines for the row selection shift registers?
  - They could be tied together, all that needs to be done is to clock once more because the data is behind one clock cycle, but it would save one line to the FPGA.
- The small LED board has the IRF4905 P-MOSFET on it, it seems like they are not a good fit, they will be exchanged for the bigger board.
  - They are on there because I ordered them thinking they were a good fit.
  - They work fine but will mess up operating the LEDs at the target voltage/current because the voltage drop changes heavily depending on the current running through it (dependant on how many LEDs are on)
  - Maybe I messed up with the test circuit, I will test again with 32 LEDs for the bigger version when designing that.
- Pullup for logic shifters is 10K which would lead to asymmetrical charge times for the shift registers.
  - See how long it actually takes to charge the lines up with 10K.
- Shift register is CMOS and the inputs have high-impedances so leaving out current limiting resistors.
  - However they are needed for N-MOSFET and P-MOSFET for example (to protect the device that is delivering the current).
  - I think they can be left out if the power supply delivers the current, and not a ÂµC which has output current limitations.
- Pullups for Logic Shifter Drains / Shift Register Inputs are not suitable for the full size board.
  - It seems like it takes a few microseconds to charge up through a 10K, this will be a big problem depending on the video properties. 24fps / 8bpp will need much lower resistor values.
- The small board uses two shift registers for the column selection on purpose even though it could have been implemented with a single one.
  - The only difference to the full size board will be that we are wiring QC to SER from the first to the second register and this only works if the data is present on QC, instead of it only being present in the buffer stage as for example with QH'.
- I think it's worth dividing the memory access, the audio playback, the video playback and the control unit into different modules / entities so they can be interchanged for different implementations such as different memory storages (Flash, SD-Card, USB-Stick) or different codecs.
- The audio and video drivers will be fed through FIFOs and some additional control signals.
- The memory driver does not need a FIFO really.
- Pull all simulations signals to 'U' when they shouldn't be read instead of driving them with '0' for example?
- 'done' was registered in the spi_memory_driver. Is this really necessary? The simulation reacts badly on it, but it should work on hardware?
- Some testbenches could make use of vhdl2008 be pulling out the internal signals as aliases but we're sticking to Vivado's Default for now ('93?)
  - Instead of duplicating the code we simply route the signals outwards, this is ok because none of this will be synthesized so nothing will be wasted.
- I've implemented some ideas for audio codecs which isn't really something that's worth documenting the process of so I'll just implement one and maybe talk about a bit about the other ideas.
