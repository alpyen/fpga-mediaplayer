Stuff that needs to be done, may be incomplete.

## Kicad
- Finish up schematic
- PCB design the smaller version aswell, so it's easier doing the bigger thing.
- Solder small version and clock in example data with push-buttons

## HDL
- Write a functional model that represents the small LED board
- Calculate timings / timing limits (shift register clocks, strobing frequency, ...)
